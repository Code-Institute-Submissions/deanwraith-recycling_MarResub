# Recycling!

The Recycling! (https://deanwraith.github.io/recycling/) website was inspired by my current job. I work as a grade 3 teacher and the children are working on a unit covering Sustainability and sharing the planet. We are specifically focusing on recycling and all the different ways they can get involved and make a difference. This website will explain different aspects of recycling and give the users tips and additional resources to help them recycle more efficiently.

The website will focus on the 3 R's; Reuse, Reduce and Recycle, and explain how important each one is and give some helpful information on how to go about implementing this in your everyday life. The information in the website will be simple to follow and include educational resources that all ages can learn from and understand.

## 1.UX
The UX considerations during the design process of the site were focused on keeping the styling simple and uniform through out the site. For first time users the focus was placed on simple, clear and interesting information and easy to follow tips and tricks to get started. Return users can get additional interest through following deeper and asking more specific questions and revisiting the FAQ page to get an idea of what other visitors have been asking and what that might lead them to want to know more about. They can also follow the videos to youtube and explore deeper into what the subject has to offer and other content makers have for these users.

### 2.3 Features to be Added
*Features can be discussed and added*

## 3. Testing
Testing of the site was done through the whole development of the site checking as a new feature or style was added on how that effected the specific pages and the functionality.

* Logo functionality - When the logo is clicked it will take you back to the home page. **Tested and passed**.
* Menu icon - When hovered over with cursor the menu dropsdown to display available pages. These can be clicked and will take you to the respective pages. In the dropdown the current page will be underlined and the page the cursor runs over will be underlined. **Tested and passed**
* Reuse, Reduce and Recycle cards - When hovered over with the mouse cursor the card will flip to display more information about the section. **Tested and passed**
* Footer - In the footer it contains 4 social media icons that link to the respective social media page. **Tested and passed**
* Reuse, Reduce and Recycle pages - There are 4 sections per page with the bottom right section containing a video. The video does not play automatically but starts once clicked. **Tested and passed**
* Header and footer - Function the same on all pages. **Tested and passed**
* Hover function on menu and flip cards for mobile changes to click function. **Menu does not close on click**.

Responsiveness testing was done using several mobile devices of different size to see the site effectiveness at different resolutions. 
The devices used were:
* Iphone SE
* IPad
* HP Elite Book Laptop as well as the Inspect function on Google Chrome Browser to test most resolutions and devices.

### 3.1 Validation Testing
* HTML
    * W3C Validator
    All HTML code was checked using this validator and was returned without any issues.
* CSS
    * Jigsaw Validator
    All css code was tested using this validator and was returned with no issues.

### 3.2 Unfixed Bugs
* I found a bug while using mobile devices where the hover setting for the dropdown menu and flip cards changed to a click and drop/flip function by default but the menu stayed open once clicked on that page even if the menu/card icon was clicked again. *My research into how to fix this bug showed that you could use java script and jquery to help the site recognize when it is being viewed on a mobile device to allow the hover function to change to a click function where a second click will close the menu or flip the card back. I felt at this stage of my studies this would involve me skipping ahead and missing some foundational work with java script and that is why I left the bug active*.
